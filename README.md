# Student Admission Management System

Our system, which was created for the Humber college admission office, asks the user to enter the names and high school course grades of each newly admitted student. The program will then determine each student’s GPA and utilize that information to allocate them to different schools(3 schools currently) depending on their GPA. In addition, the system provides four reports based on the final total of accepted students.
